# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# This workflow defines the Continuous Integration (CI) process for the social-dashboard project.
# It runs on every pull request targeting the 'main' branch to ensure code quality and stability.
# The workflow checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies using pnpm,
# and then runs the linting and build commands defined in package.json.
# This helps catch errors and style issues before they are merged into the main codebase.
